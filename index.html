            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The overall plan for <strong>PyOptics</strong> is to deepen my understanding of optical physics by studying <em>Adams' and Hughes' Optics f2f</em> and implementing key concepts in Python simulations. This interactive website will serve as a teaching tool, aimed at audiences ranging from primary school students to undergraduate Physics majors.</p>
            <p>Through this project, I aim to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhance my Python programming and coding skills.</li>
                <li>Document and explain the physics of optics in detail.</li>
                <li>Create a resource that can be used as an educational aid for learning optics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p><strong>PyOptics</strong> is an educational project focused on simulating and visualizing optical concepts through interactive diagrams and simulations. The goal is to communicate optics principles at various levels, from basic concepts to advanced theories, while improving my programming skills and understanding of optics.</p>
