<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The overall plan for this project is to improve my understanding of optical physics through reading Adams' and Hughes' Opticsf2f and implementing the ideas in a Python simulation
    and somehow visualising in some form of interactive website. I hope to be able to improve my Python and other programming skills in this project, as well as write some detailed
    documentation/notes on the Physics.</p>

<p>I am hoping to produce some final product that could be used as an aide to teaching Optics to a wide range of ages, from primary school to undergraduate Physics.</p>

<h2>THIS IS A TEST UPDATE TO THE SITE</h2>
