            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The overall plan for <strong>PyOptics</strong> is to improve my understanding of optical physics through reading <em>Adams' and Hughes' Optics f2f</em> and implementing the ideas in Python simulations. These simulations will be visualized on an interactive website, which will also serve as a resource to teach Optics to a wide range of ages, from primary school students to undergraduate Physics students.</p>
            <p>Through this project, I aim to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhance my Python programming and coding skills.</li>
                <li>Write detailed documentation and notes on the Physics of optics.</li>
                <li>Create a final product that can be used as an educational aid.</li>
            </ul>
