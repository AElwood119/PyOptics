# PyOptics

The overall plan for this project is to improve my understanding of optical physics through reading Adams' and Hughes' Opticsf2f and implementing the ideas in a python simulation. I also hope to be able to improve my Python skills in this project. As I go, I will update this repo with code and documentation to explain it.
