# PyOptics

## Introduction
The overall plan for **PyOptics** is to improve my understanding of optical physics through reading *Adams' and Hughes' Optics f2f* and implementing the ideas in Python simulations. These simulations will be visualized on an interactive website, which will also serve as a resource to teach Optics to a wide range of ages, from primary school students to undergraduate Physics students.

Through this project, I aim to:
- Enhance my Python programming and coding skills.
- Write detailed documentation and notes on the Physics of optics.
- Create a final product that can be used as an educational aid.

## Project Description
**PyOptics** is an educational project focused on simulating and visualizing optical concepts through interactive diagrams and simulations. The project aims to communicate various levels of Optics knowledge, from basic principles to advanced topics, improving both my programming skills and understanding of Optics.

## Planned Features
- **Simulations:** Create Python-based simulations of optical phenomena, such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
- **Interactive Diagrams:** Develop interactive diagrams that help users visualize key optics concepts.
- **Educational Content:** Document Optics knowledge for various educational levels, from introductory concepts to university-level theories.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Host the project online for easy access and interaction.

## Installation
To get started with the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyoptics.git
    cd pyoptics
    ```
2. Install dependencies (will be updated as the project progresses).

## Usage
Once the project is functional, this section will provide instructions for running simulations and interacting with diagrams.
